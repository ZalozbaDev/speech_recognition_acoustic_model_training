# Audio augmentation

Clean speech recordings can be used for augmentation by introducing background noise with random levels, efectively doubling the available amount of speech data.

Augmentation provides larger amount of diverse speech data necessary for creation of robust triphone models.

Inputs:

* files containing noise to be added
    * check folder inputs/noise
    * information about the origin of these files can be found in the same folder
